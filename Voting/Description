Voting is an ensemble machine learning algorithm.

For regression, a voting ensemble involves making a prediction that is the average of multiple other regression models.

In classification, a hard voting ensemble involves summing the votes for crisp class labels from other models and predicting the class with the most votes.
A soft voting ensemble involves summing the predicted probabilities for class labels and predicting the class label with the largest sum probability.
