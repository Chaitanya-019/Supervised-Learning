In machine learning, boosting is an ensemble meta-algorithm for primarily reducing bias, and also variance in supervised learning, 
and a family of machine learning algorithms that convert weak learners to strong ones.
In this directory the following types of boosting techniques are implemented:
(i) Adaptive Boosting( ADA Boosting)
(ii) Gradient Boosting
(iii) XG Boosting
