Decision Tree is one of the most commonly used, practical approaches for supervised learning.
It can be used to solve both Regression and Classification tasks with the latter being put more into practical application.
It is a tree-structured classifier with three types of nodes. 
The Root Node is the initial node which represents the entire sample and may get split further into further nodes. 
The Interior Nodes represent the features of a data set and the branches represent the decision rules. Finally, the Leaf Nodes represent the outcome.
This algorithm is very useful for solving decision-related problems.
