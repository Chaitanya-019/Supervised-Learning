Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable. 
The nature of target or dependent variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible classes.
Mathematically, a logistic regression model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X.

Here the logistic classifer is in implemented in differnt ways
(i) For digit recognition
(ii) On Universal Bank Dataset
(iii) from Stastical models
(iv) Using Select from model which gives best parameters for model
(v) Using Pipeline along with data modification like PCA, Scaling
